useContext Hook in React

ðŸ“– Introduction:
The useContext Hook allows you to access React context directly in functional components. It simplifies state management by eliminating the need for prop drilling, making data accessible to deeply nested components without passing props manually.

ðŸš€ Why useContext?
Provides global state management within a component tree.
Eliminates prop drilling, reducing unnecessary prop passing.
Improves code readability and maintainability.

ðŸ“Œ Common Use Cases:
âœ” Sharing theme or language preferences across components
âœ” Managing authentication state globally
âœ” Centralized user data or app settings
âœ” Accessing global state without Redux or external libraries

âš¡ Behavior of useContext:
Consumes context without needing a Consumer component.
Automatically re-renders components when the context value changes.
Works best with Reactâ€™s Context API to manage shared state.

ðŸ›  Best Practices:
Group related data into a single context to avoid multiple providers.
Use context only when necessary to prevent excessive re-renders.
Combine useReducer with useContext for better state management in large applications.

ðŸ“œ Key Takeaways:
useContext simplifies accessing shared state in React applications.
Helps avoid prop drilling, making components cleaner and more maintainable.
Best used with React Context API for effective global state management.
